                    History
                </h2>
                <h3>
                    Ransomeware is a very old technique that looms its head over 
                    the interwebs. It is dated back to 1989 where the first instance of Ransomeware first propped up. Written by Joeseph Popp, the malware program dubbed AIDS Trojan sent out compromised diskettes named: AIDS Information - Introductory Diskettes to attendees of the internal AIDS conference at the World Health Organization. It encrypted the file names on the victims' computer - hiding the directories. Those wanting access to their files were asked to pay $189 to PC Cyborg Corp. at a mailbox in Panama in order to get the repair tool. Though a flaw in the program was that it was possible to obtain the decryption key from the code itself. This idea and methods has been evoling ever since to utilizing public key cryptography to properly hide the encryption key and being used against all manners of people and organizaions - a special focus on the latter. Organizations tend to be affected more often, like what recently happened to <a href="https://www.bcps.org/updates">Baltimore County Public Schools</a>, usually for larger sums of money, to simply be a hiderance for the organization, or to make/demonstrate a political statement to them and/or the public.

                                Basically what this means is that the device affected has malware that causes nuisances for the owner with occasional pops on the device notifying them that the device is in such a state that needs attention and by following the provided link one can fix it. The malware is right in that the computer contains a virus just a much better option the owner go to a Security/IT Specialist to fix the issue.

                                This is a little bit more real. This malware does its name, locks your screen preventing you from access from device until the specified demands is met...that is if there is one. Usually money is demanded but it is known that they sometimes just don't give any - just to annoy the victim and cause them strife. This however can fixed usually if followed through the right channels. Usually attained through suspicious channels like fishy links.

                                Of all the types, this is the scariest situation to be in. If you're afflicted by this that means your personal files are locked from the owner and encrypted with a unique key only known by the hacker and unobtainable through any other means but them. They may still have the same behavior but it is noted that even if you agree to the demands they might lay out it is no gaurentee that the victim will get access back to the files on the device. These attacks are acquired by clicking questionale links on the internet - though they are hidden very well the more sophisticated the malware is.

                        <li>
                            Consistent, periodic, frequent backups of the data of your device's storage drives. This minimizes the effects of a succesful attacks with spares of your important files; you will be kicking yourself if don't and an attack occurs.

                            Ensure your Operating System and Cybersecurity program of choice is always up-to-date. These hackers look for vulnerabilities in the OS your device is running but it is in good interest of the manufacturer to keep ensure safety gain consumer confidence and loyalty.

                            since it encourages the criminals of enacting more crimes and of course there is no gaurentee that the device will be freed from them - they always demand more or simply not hold up their end of the deal.

                        <li>
                            Seek free decryptors. Depending on the software used to deploy the malware it may have had its decryptors leaked online by do-gooders to relieve people of their burden. Though this is not reliable and can possibly encrypt files further if the wrong decryptor was used.

                            For Screenlocking in particular a full system restore may prove useful or even a factory reset may be the only case. Though a Security/IT Specialist should be consulted before action is taken.
